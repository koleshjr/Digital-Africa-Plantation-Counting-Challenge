# Digital-Africa-Plantation-Counting-Challenge
The objective of this challenge is to create a semi-supervised machine learning algorithm to count the number of palm oil trees in an image.

Palm oil is an edible vegetable oil derived from the mesocarp (reddish pulp) of the fruit of the oil palms. The oil is used in food manufacturing, beauty products, and as biofuel.
This will aid farmers to determine the number of trees on their plot and estimated crop yield. The semi supervised nature of this solution will allow this solution to be applied to other plantations such as banana palms.
